As the global logistics industry continues to evolve, technology is playing an increasingly important role. Real-time data is revolutionizing how companies manage their fleet and cargo, enabling greater efficiency, accuracy, and cost savings. But the use of data also has implications for legal and compliance issues, such as cargo claims and transportation law.<br />
